        <div class="questions">The Sydney Opera House is one of the world's busiest performing arts venues and aims for
            excellence in
            online
            customer engagement. Please outline how you think your skills and experience will assist you in contributing
            to
            Sydney Opera House web development.<br /><br />
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">I believe that I am an ideal candidate to contribute to Sydney Opera House web
            development because of my
            skill level and experience in Information Systems and front-end development, my passion for visual and
            performing arts and my experience working in teams and adding my personality and attention to detail into a
            positive work environment.<br /><br />

            <div>I graduated with a <strong>Bachelor of Commerce and Fine Arts majoring in Information Systems at
                    UNSW</strong> in 2021. This
                degree gave me foundational skills in development, implementation and testing of Information Systems.
                Crucially, however, it cultivated my creative sensibilities and attention to visual details that
                continue to
                empower my professional life enmeshed within the world of coding and web development.<br /><br /></div>

            The past year has been one of my most rewarding. My graduate employment at Infosys allowed me to expand my
            knowledge in web development and gave me real industry experience, while also integrating these skills into
            a project-focused team-based
            working environment. The company offered further learning, which I grabbed with both hands, often
            autonomously studying outside of work requirements. I am now trained and operationally experienced in
            JavaScript, HTML, React JS, CSS, Bootstrap, Java, and SQL. Further, I worked extensively on multiple
            capstone projects with Infosys to collaboratively design and develop source code using GitHub.
        </div>
        <div style="padding: 40px;">
            <div class="highlight">My passion for web development has been nurtured by my love for art and design. I am
                a
                practising artist and
                find myself driven by my own creative touch and the creative touch of those around me. I plan to use my
                eye
                for colours and balance to celebrate and highlight upcoming events through clear and exciting layouts,
                as
                well as use my experience as an avid customer of performing arts to critically consider the customer
                journey
                through the platform and its ease of use. My artistic intuition has always buttressed my passion for web
                development, and I am incredibly grateful for the skills it has honed in me to creatively problem solve
                and
                compulsively pay attention to detail.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">I have consistently worked to support local and Sydney-based art, volunteering at <a
                href="https://ra.co/events/1289602" target="_blank">Soft
                Center</a> at the Casula
            Powerhouse in 2019, the UNSW Art and Design Open Day in 2019, and the <a
                href="https://wierdwomen.squarespace.com/about" target="_blank">Wierd Women</a> retreat in 2021, amongst
            others. I took this passion to gear up as a co-organiser of both the Inner Scribes Exhibition in 2020, and
            the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rootsfestival_">Roots</a>
            Creative Gathering for Women in 2021 and 2023. Taking on those leadership roles has been a challenge that I
            have rued. It has offered me experience working closely with large groups of creative people while also
            coordinating operations, deadlines and human resources before, during, and post events.<br /><br />

            I thrive on opportunity, and bring charisma, personability, creativity and an eagerness to learn that is
            unmatchable. I am motivated to make visual arts and events an integral part of my career in programming and
            I would bring
            a unique level of passion and commitment to the role, as well as the concrete technological skills to
            achieve excellence in online customer engagement.</div>

        <div class="questions">As a Front-end Developer you will have created or contributed to an array of exciting
            projects. Tell us
            about
            the one you are most proud of and why?<br /><br />
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">The project I am most proud of was working with Tennis Australia to reimagine and
            redesign the delivery of Tennis Victoria’s youth program, <a
                href="https://www.tennis.com.au/vic/players/programs/future-leaders" target="_blank">“Future
                Leaders”</a>. Future Leaders
            facilitates youth to volunteer and support their local tennis clubs in camps. My team and I were assigned to
            digitalise and integrate the course component into Insosy’s Springboard Platform, this allowing the program
            to be coordinated centrally and administered online. Our task was the central component in the program’s
            entire reimagining, and I thrived with this responsibility.<br /><br />
            The project demanded the dedication of myself and my co-worker, working long hours to
            complete its implementation from planning to execution to analytics. As programmers, our understanding
            of the platform and the available technologies allowed us to aid Tennis Victoria to redefine their
            requirements and understand the potential of various programming options to illustrate and animate their
            content.When it came to designing, we were in contact with a design agency which consolidated
            our knowledge of web page accessibility and usability, as well as industry best practices.We designed
            the web courses following Tennis Victoria's brand guidelines, colours, fonts, logos. At the end of the
            first camp, we prepared and shared analytics with Tennis Victoria.<br /><br />

            For me personally, I took to heart some of the client’s feedback about how digitalizing
            the content had allowed the program to expand their community time and changed the Future Leaders
            Program to the core. I find much joy in web development when it facilitates ease for a group or company I am
            passionate about. Ultimately, I was also very proud of the design and interactivity of the webpages.<br />
            My main takeaway from this project was to not limit deliverables to my current skill set as a programmer. I
            learnt to listen to the client’s wants and needs and research which technology could be the solution to the
            challenge, then upskill myself.</div>
