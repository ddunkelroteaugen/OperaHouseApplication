        <p>I am applying for this job with skills and knowledge which matches the essential skills
            required for the
            position. I have graduated from a <strong>Bachelor of Commerce and Fine Arts at UNSW majoring in Information
                Systems</strong>,
            giving me technical skills to execute the Key Accountabilities as well as the passion and attention to
            detail to
            deliver the excellence desired. I have studied Information Systems extensively from development to
            implementation and testing. I have received training on Front-end Development technologies as part of my
            graduate position at Infosys, and have since been upskilling myself in the areas of Front-end Development,
            nominally JavaScript, HTML, and React JS, driven by my interest to involve these technologies in my career.
            My
            experience at Infosys has given me experience working with clients in a timely manner as well as working
            collaboratively on source code using Github.<br />

            Through studying Sculpture, Installation and Performance and Spatial Design, I have studied the value an
            impeccable presentation adds to projects, and have since applied this in my Art and professional
            practice.<br />
            <br />


            I am passionate about visual and performing arts and have always worked to support my community
            through
            attending shows, volunteering at events such as <a href="https://ra.co/events/1289602" target="_blank">Soft
                Centre</a> at Casula Powerhouse and Open Days at UNSW Art and
            Design, or <a href="https://wierdwomen.squarespace.com/about" target="_blank">Weird Women</a> at Wisemans
            Ferry
            and co-organising Arts and Music events, including <a href="http://selmabenkaza.com/innerscribeexhibition"
                target="_blank">Inner
                Scribes</a> and recently <a href="http://instagram.com/rootsfestival_" target="_blank">Roots</a>. Being
            able
            to give back to my community through working for one of its pillars with the skills
            I
            trained for and my desired career is a full loop opportunity.
            <br /><br />

            I will passionately work to hold myself to the standards of Sydney Opera Houses professionalism and what
            they do
            for the Arts community in Australia and the World. I am motivated to make visual arts and events an integral
            part of my career. I am easy to work with, creative, enterprising, polyvalent, eager to learn, and dedicated
            to
            working with clients and staff to create the best possible experience for visitors.

        <div class="questions">As a Front-end Developer you will have created or contributed to an array of exciting
            projects. Tell us
            about
            the one you are most proud of and why?
        </div>
        <p>Working for Tennis Victoria is the most fulfilling project I have been part of so far. Tennis Victoria hosts
            a yearly Youth Program called Future Leaders (link) which entails volunteering project at their local Tennis
            Club, as well as an outdoor camp consisting of games, and previously face to face classes. We were solicited
            to digitalise and integrate the course component into Infosys’s Springboard platform. Our mission was part
            of a rearrangement of the whole program.<br /><br />
            In terms of learning and achievements, I have gained a great understanding of processes from planning to
            design, execution, and analytics – As programmers, our understanding of the platform and the available
            technologies allowed us to informatively help Tennis Victoria define their requirements and understand their
            possibilities and options. When it came to designing, we were in contact with a design agency which
            consolidated our knowledge of webpage accessibility and usability, as well as industry best practices. We
            designed the web courses following Tennis Victoria’s brand guidelines, colours, fonts, logos. At the end of
            the first camp, we prepared and shared analytics with Tennis Victoria.<br /><br />
            On a personal level, my contact client has shared with us how much of an impact digitalizing the learning
            component of the program has had on the program as a whole, allowing the outdoor camp to only focus on
            community time, games, and sports. This heart-warming feedback left my co programmer and I very satisfied of
            the experience. Ultimately, I am also very proud of the design and interactivity of the
            webpages.<br /><br />
            I would also like to mention working on building my own website (currently WIP) to display my Art and Design
            work has been my most exciting ongoing project so far. Working to build my own brand, to incorporate my
            personality and visual identity with intention in every detail has been very enriching. It has given me the
            opportunity to research and learn new frameworks such as Three.JS to not limit my vision to my current
            skills. As this has been a solo project from the start, it is helping me gain a deep and extensive
            understanding of the process, and it has allowed me to try different frameworks to find the most suited
            tools for what I want to deliver.
