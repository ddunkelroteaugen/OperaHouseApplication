            The project I am most proud of is working with Tennis Australia to reimagine and redesign the delivery
            of Tennis Victoria’s youth program, “Future Leaders”. <a
                href="https://www.tennis.com.au/vic/players/programs/future-leaders" target="_blank">Future Leaders</a>
            facilitates youth to
            volunteer and support their local tennis clubs in camps. My team and I were assigned to <strong>digitalise and
            integrate the course component into Insosy’s Springboard Platform</strong>, thus allowing part of the program to be
            coordinated centrally and administered online. Our task was the central component in the program’s
            entire reimagining, and I thrived with this responsibility.

    <div id="p-six" class="hide" style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-around;">
        <div class="paragraph six">The project demanded the dedication of myself and my co-worker, working long
            hours to complete its implementation from planning to execution to analytics. As programmers, our
            understanding of the platform and the available technologies allowed us to aid Tennis Victoria to
            redefine their requirements and understand the potential of various programming options to illustrate
            and animate their content. </div>

        <div class="paragraph seven">When it came to designing, we were in contact with a design agency which
            consolidated our knowledge of web page accessibility and usability, as well as industry best
            practices.We designed the web courses following Tennis Victoria's brand guidelines, colours, fonts,
            logos. At the end of the first camp, we prepared and shared analytics with Tennis Victoria. </div>

    <div id="p-eight" class="hide">
        <div class="paragraph eight">For me personally, I took to heart some of the client’s feedback about how
            digitalizing the content had allowed the program to expand their community time and changed the Future
            Leaders Program to the core. I find much joy in web development when it facilitates ease for a group or
            company I am passionate about. Ultimately, I was also very proud of the design and interactivity of the
            webpages. My main takeaway from this project was to <strong>never limit the deliverables to my current skill
                set as a
                programmer.</strong> I learnt to listen to the client’s wants and needs and research which technology
            could be
            the solution to the challenge, then upskill myself.
